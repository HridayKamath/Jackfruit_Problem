# Jackfruit Problem
Python Image Processing project 

This Python project was developed using Google Colab and makes use of libraries such as OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, Matplotlib, and ipywidgets for image processing. The program allows the user to upload an image of their choice, convert it to grayscale, adjust its brightness and contrast, and view an edge-detected version of the image. Histograms are also generated for each stage of processing, showing the relationship between pixel intensity and the number of pixels.

The code and corresponding output screenshots have been attached to this repository.
